### Hello Wanderer!

<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=C86-moe"/>

I am ***Chise Hachiroku***, currently an undergraduate at the University of Manchester. Without doubt this is *NOT* my real name.

You may find my email address on the information section, and you can [see all my projects here](https://c86.ac.cn/project/). I sometimes also write blogs focusing on discussions of topics that I feel somewhat confident in writing, and you can [find them here](https://c86.ac.cn/blog/).

Actively looking for 2024 summer internship. Will be sending out CV and cover letters starting from late June 2023.
