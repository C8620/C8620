## Hello Wanderer!

I am ***Chise Hachiroku***, currently an undergraduate at the [University of Manchester](man.ac.uk) (this is the one in the UK). My legal name is '*Yang Hu*'.

You may find my email address on the information section, and you can [see all my projects here](https://c86.ac.cn/project/). I sometimes also write blogs focusing on discussions of topics that I feel somewhat confident in writing, and you can [find them here](https://chise.hachiroku.uk/#writings).

My primary language is C and C++, with frequent uses of Python and PHP. I am willing to employ any language to accomplish the goals if required, and have experiences in writing of Java, JS, Haskell, Rust, and even ARM Assembly.

Due to some constraints (commercial and private), some of my best C++ projects are subject to distribution bans, but a lot of hobby repos written in PHP are now publicly available. Contributor of [LoliWorks](https://loli.works/) in free time.

Actively looking for 2024 summer internship, and sending out CV and cover letters to a very considerable number of firms.
