### Hello Wanderer!

I am ***Chise Hachiroku***, currently an undergraduate at the University of Manchester. Without doubt this is *NOT* my real name.

You may find my email address on the information section, and you can [see all my projects here](https://c86.ac.cn/project/). I sometimes also write blogs focusing on discussions of topics that I feel somewhat confident in writing, and you can [find them here](https://c86.ac.cn/blog/).

My primary language is C and C++, but I am also willing to use a wide range of other languages to accomplish the goals. Due to a lot of constraints, may of my public repos are coded using PHP, but I still like using C the most.

Actively looking for 2024 summer internship. Will be sending out CV and cover letters starting from late June 2023.
