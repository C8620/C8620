## Hello Wanderer!

I am ***Chise Hachiroku***, a graduate of the [University of Manchester](man.ac.uk) (this is the one in the UK). My legal name is '*Yang Hu*'. I am about to start my career as a General Purpose Software Engineer.

You may find my email address in the information section. I currently maintain a blog for my writings and some photos taken, which can be found at [8620.uk](https://chise.hachiroku.com/). 

My primary languages are C and C++, with frequent use of Python and PHP. I am willing to employ any language to accomplish the goals if required, and have experience in writing MySQL, Java, JS, Haskell, Rust, and even Verilog or ARM Assembly (AArch32).

Due to some constraints (commercial and private), some of my best C++ projects are subject to distribution bans, but a lot of hobby repos written in PHP are now publicly available.

My projects and outputs are under the name of [LoliWorks](https://loli.works/), which I contribute to in my free time and previously took on some commercial partnerships.

_'Graduated'_ AI Intern at Huawei Technologies (SRC), member of UoM's regional champion at UKIEPC of ICPC, and represented the University in TUDelft at NWERC 2023. 

~~Currently looking for a job when I graduate in July 2025. [Please email here if you are an employer interested.](mailto:)~~ I finally have found myself a job.
