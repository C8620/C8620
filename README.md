## Hello Wanderer!

I am ***Chise Hachiroku***, currently an undergraduate at the University of Manchester (this is the UK one). My legal name is '*Yang Hu*'.

You may find my email address on the information section, and you can [see all my projects here](https://c86.ac.cn/project/). I sometimes also write blogs focusing on discussions of topics that I feel somewhat confident in writing, and you can [find them here](https://c86.ac.cn/blog/).

My primary language is C and C++, but I am willing to employ a wide range of other languages to accomplish the goals. My other commonly used languages are Python, Java, and PHP.

Due to some constraints (commercial and private), much of my C projects are forbidden to distribute, but a lot of hobby repos written in PHP are now publicly available. Contributor of [LoliWorks](https://loli.works/) in free time.

Actively looking for 2024 summer internship, and sending out CV and cover letters to a very considerable number of firms.
